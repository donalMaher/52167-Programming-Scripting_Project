    2.Iris virginica
    3.Iris versicolor
The four features that were measured to determine the species are: 
    1.sepals lenght
    2.sepals width
    3.petals lenght
    4.petals width
"Wikipedia", Fisher developed a linear discrimant model to distinguish the species from each other. 
The  term cluster analysis and the differences between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining.
