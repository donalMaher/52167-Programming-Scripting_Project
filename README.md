# 52167-Programming-Scripting_Project
Introduction:
    This project will investigate the well-know Fishers Iris data set. The creation of a python program will allow for the delivery of analysis for the data set. Using the python program, the user will be able to identfiy the differences  between species of Iris .
Running the code: 
    navigate to the directory in which the analysis.py currently resides. write the command python analysis.py to run the code. 
Overview:
    The Iris is a species of flowering plants with showy flowers. In 1936 Ronald Fisher a british statistican and biologist used three Iris varieties to create the Iris flower data set to create a example of linear discriminant analysis. This was accumpilised by measuring the features of each species.      
Investigition to understand the dataset.
    The dataset used here is widely used to teach students techinques in statistics. the dataset is of good quality and without missing fields.
    "Wikipedia" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.
    linear discriminant analysis: 
    The dataset contains 150 entries of recorded values which were used to identify the different species of Iris.
    DataSet summary:
    About the data set
    The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. This is a very famous and widely used dataset by everyone trying to learn machine learning and statistics. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. 
    The dataset contains samples of three species of Iris:
        1.Iris setosa
        2.Iris virginica
        3.Iris versicolor
    The four features that were measured to determine the species are: 
        1.sepals lenght
        2.sepals width
        3.petals lenght
        4.petals width
    These features will now be refered to as variables of the species. 
"Wikipedia", Fisher developed a linear discrimant model to distinguish the species from each other. 
The  term cluster analysis and the differences between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining.

Notes: 
Summary is completed.
Task 2 to be completed: The program saves a histogram of each variable to png files.
Task 3 to be competed: The program outputs a scatter plot of each pair of varaibles.
