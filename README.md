# 52167-Programming-Scripting_Project
Introduction:
    This project will investigate the well-know Fishers Iris data set.Using this dataset and the python program, the user will be able to identfiy the difference species of Iris.
    The Iris is a species of flowering plants with showy flowers. In 1936 Ronald Fisher used three Iris varieties to create the Iris flower data set to measure    
Investigition to understand the dataset.
    The dataset contains 150 entries of recorded values which were used to identify the different species of Iris

DataSet summary: 
The dataset contains samples of three species of Iris:
    1.Iris setosa
    2.Iris virginica
    3.Iris versicolor
The four features that were measured to determine the species are: 
    1.sepals lenght
    2.sepals width
    3.petals lenght
    4.petals width
"Wikipedia", Fisher developed a linear discrimant model to distinguish the species from each other. 
The  term cluster analysis and the differences between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining.
