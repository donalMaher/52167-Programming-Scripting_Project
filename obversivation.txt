The histogram: represents the frequencey distribution of data point. 
*frequencey distribution is useful for showing the occurance of a variable
The histograms created on the variables, really dont show any great insite into
the classification. the histograms just shows the count of the entire petal width or petal lenght
Determining the differenct specices on this type of data set using a histogram cannot be done. 
Figure 1,2,3,4
in figure 1, the axis y is count and x axis is 
In the figures show lenght and width show no Determining of the species.
Even if the data was cluster in the specices

The scatter plot: This 2 dementional plot shows the sepal length and sepal width 
its clear that the blue points are easyly Determining one of the specices,
but the other 2 cannot be idenfitied as individual specices as they cannot be seperted from each other
